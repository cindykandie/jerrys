<p>I am not doing any interviews currently.
I am however pondering on doing them in future.
While I can provide valuable content, I am usually not available for skype meetings, Long messages and tons of emails. Unless something is very urgent, I will usually try to reply to emails 12 hours max after you have sent one. For urgent assignments, I will usually reply in about 1 hour from the time I receive the email.
 I consider urgent assignments to be those with a deadline of fewer than 24 hours. There are some I am still not able to help you with,
  such as, do my 25 pages in 3 hours, and I will pay you $10,000. Thats a lie.
  I dont know/believe anybody can meet that deadline. The best time to contact me would be between (0:00-0800 EST) New York time.
  <br> Fill the form.<br> Please address it as urgent, on the subject and get very specific on the direct help you would like me to provide.<br>
   You could, for example,<br> Write: <span>Urgent! 10-page essay due in 8 hours. Let me know if you can help me.</span><br> If you dont hear from me in
   about 30 minutes after sending the email, consider it not available.

  <p>For urgent requests, please use the following email (insert email). Should you have anything you would like me to talk about, shoot in my email, and I will reply after 24 hours, maximum. I am working, meanwhile, on getting assistants and an assistant, to help with any questions you may have.

Thank you for reasoning with my systems, which allow me to be effective in my contribution to you.</p>
